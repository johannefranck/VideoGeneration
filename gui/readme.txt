### GUI
This directory contains code for the GUI. It's honestly a bit hacky, but should work as long as you install pygame and SAM:

```
pip install pygame
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

### Instructions
- Change the type of flow generated by editing the `MODE` variable.
- Launch by running `python gui.py` in the command line
- Click anywhere to segment object with SAM
- Wait for SAM to finish processing and the segmentation to be displayed
- Click and drag arrows to make flow
- Press `enter` to save flow and mask
